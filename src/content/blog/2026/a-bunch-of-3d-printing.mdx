With the hardware pieces acquired, the next problem to solve was how to position
the camera (and attached device) to record the action.

## Goals

I had some basic requirements for how I wanted to mount the camera:

- adjustable - be able to position the components and point them in a given spot
- well-fitted - the camera and Pi should not fall into the water (by accident or
  otherwise)
- temporary - be able to detach and pack away when done

Rather than look for pieces off the shelf, I ended up 3D printing what I needed
based on the ability to modify existing designs to suit my needs.

## First attempt

As a novice to 3D printing, I started searching for reference components that I
could adapt to my situation. I had a vision of being able to attach the case
onto the side of the reservoir (with the device on the outside) and somehow
mounting the camera on the post that holds the lights, so that the camera could
be pointed down on the dirt.

### Raspberry Pi case

For mounting the case, I started with the
[Raspberry Pi Zero Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1165227) published by
Adafruit.

This design had some attributes that I wanted to modify:

- the camera connector was covered, and thus not accessible
- the 40-pin header was exposed
- no ability to attach the case to the reservoir

### Camera arm

This component was more intricate, but I ended up finding
[Raspberry Pi Camera Mount with Ball Joint for Reprap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:247590)
which gave me 90% of what I needed.

/>

The remaining 10% was:

- modify the mount to attach to the square post holding the grow lights
- modify the camera case component to suit the camera and circuit board
  (basically hollow out the frame and front-facing case)

### Finished installation

The installation itself went rather smoothly, aside from the bolts to hold the
components together being slightly too small and warping some of the more
fragile PLA components.

I never did get the camera case component to sit flush - hence the rubber band
holding the back and front pieces together.

### Learnings

The setup worked reasonably well for the time it was running, but had some
shortfalls:

- due to the short cable length, the camera arm could not be mounted very high,
  which meant the photos taken included the grow lights themselves, and these
  added artifacts that look like interlacing to the time lapse

<video controls width="600">
  <source src={VideoWithEffect} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

- the camera arm had to be positioned low due to the short cable, and reaching
  in to rotate the seedlings introduced the risk of bump the camera out of
  position, which then required troubleshooting to get back into a good enough
  position (this happened at least 4 times from memory)

## Second iteration

With the learnings from the first run of this setup, I only had one big change
in mind: figure out a way to mount the case on the post. This would allow me to
mount the camera higher up and look downwards on the seedlings, and I suspected
that lifting the camera up higher would also make it harder to accidentally
touch and move the camera position.

### Raspberry Pi case

I went back to the previous case I'd used and added a couple of tweaks:

- post connector to attach the case and sit flush
- notch on the clip to slot into the post connector (and not slide out of the
  clip)

This was not a fruitful exercise, as I kept messing up the print because I was
also rusty at this:

- the first one's clip was too narrow and I printed it on the wrong side
- the second one I forgot to print supports for and the case did not look great
  on the exterior (you'll see this in the photos below)
- the third one broke during removal of the supports because I made it too thin

I ended up using the second attempt for this run because it worked great aside
from the visuals.

I didn't make a change to the camera arm, aside. from adding some Blu Tack onto
the ball joint to keep it in a given position. The PLA seems to have changed it
shape since the last time and would not "lock" into the desired position.
