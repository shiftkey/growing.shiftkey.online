			<h1>Hi there. Let's Grow...</h1>
			<p>
				This is a small website where I'm documenting and sharing the annual planting of seeds that I do 
				before they can be transplanted outside in the spring.
			</p>
			<div>
				<Image width={1600} height={1600} src={CurrentShot} alt="A view of the camera arm and the seed starters under the grow light" />
			</div>
			<p>
				The view from the camera as of <strong>{getTimeText()} on {getDateText()}</strong> is uneventful, but that's
				because the seeds were planted on <strong>February 14</strong>. Do check back in later.
			</p>
			<p>
				This year I'm mostly focused on getting peppers started, as we often use these for cooking
				as well as in hot sauces. But there are some colourful options in this batch, and the local bees
				are fans of the flowers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to the short growing season in my part of Canada - June through to September unless the plants
				can tolerate frost -  starting seeds indoors under lights is common, and many plants benefit from
				the head start compared to direct sowing.
			</p>
			<p>
				For those who want to read about the details, check out <a href="/blog">the blog</a>. Now that the setup
				is up and gathering images, I'll have time to actually write more about what's happening
				under the hood, as well as write up my earlier attempt at this back in 2023 that I had to abandon.
